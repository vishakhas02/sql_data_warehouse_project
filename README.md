## 🚀 Project Requirements

**🎯 Objective:**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**🧾 Specifications:**

1. **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.  
2. **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.  
3. **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.  
4. **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.  
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
