</p>
1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

##üöÄ **Project Requirements**
<hr>
Objective :
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.
Specifications :
1. Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
2. Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
3. Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
4. Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
5. Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
